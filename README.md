# SpaceShooter
##GamePlay
This project was created alongside chat gpt to assist with areas I was not familiar with. The game was created completely in the Java language. The majority of the program was written from prior experience writing games and following tutorials on youtube.

The game includes the following:
*A space shooter similar to Galaga where the player is on the bottom of the screen roaming through space shooting enemies that appear from the left of the screen
*Four levels that introduce each enemy
*A final level that randomly spawns enemies that will continue the game indefinitely
*enemies use a rectangle collision box to detect when the player is in range to shoot at player
*Game music and sound effects
*A space background that loops through 10 pictures of stars

background and player were taken from Google and repainted in Microsoft Paint
